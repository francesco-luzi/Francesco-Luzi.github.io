After completing my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering, I spent three years at Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL) where my primary focus was on data processing and collection. During this tenure, I worked on numerous projects and gained expertise in programming languages such as Python, C++, C, CUDA, and Matlab, utilizing them for various projects.

In 2020, I transitioned to Duke University to pursue a PhD under the guidance of Leslie Collins at the Applied Machine Learning Lab. My research at Duke centered on investigating the impact of object scale on detection algorithms and enhancing model robustness to scale variations. Additionally, I delved into diverse tasks including zero-shot detection and segmentation, style transfer, architecture exploration, occlusion robustness, and tackling inverse problems.

Overall, my professional journey spans both industrial and academic settings, where I have honed my skills in data analysis, programming, and machine learning techniques, contributing to advancements in the field of machine learning.
